    <h3>General Summary</h3>
    <p>This week in ECE102, me and my partner made some major developments with our mouse trap car.</p>
    <p>With some insight from our instructor, we realized that our current model could most likely handle the distance, speed, and displacement requirements. </p>
    <p>We made some adjustments, which helped exploit some issues we have with the car (too much pressure, axle flying off in some trial runs).</p>
    <p>My partner Alex couldn't resist to work on it at home, and made some major structural changes to the car. I've yet to see them, but apparently it goes farther now.</p>
    <p>As for the online course, I watched half of a 12 year old documentary called "Digital Nation", and wrote corresponding discussions about it.</p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>I feel that this week, and the previous week in particular, that I tapped into the engineer mindset.</p>
    <p>Me and my partner Alex went a bare bones approach with our car, but still made a lot of progress with our vehicle. </p>
    <p>As for the documentary, there wasn't much of anything new that I learned. It was mostly all common sense to me, because we have made a lot of technological headway since it was released.</p>
